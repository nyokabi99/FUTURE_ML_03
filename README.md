## TOPIC: BOOK RECOMMENDATION CHATBOT PROJECT
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered book recommendation chatbot.
The chatbot suggests books based on user preferences such as genre, rating, author, and publication year.
While the model is built and 
tested locally, it has not been deployed yet.

### Objectives
+ Develop a chatbot to interact with users and gather their book preferences.

+ Implement a recommendation system to suggest books based on user input.

+ Test the chatbot locally to ensure it provides accurate recommendations.

+ Prepare the system for future deployment by ensuring modular and scalable design.
  
### Filtering Process
The recommendation system follows a content-based filtering approach:

+ Genre Filtering – Matches books based on the user’s preferred genre.

+ Rating Filtering – Recommends books with higher ratings.

+ Year Filtering – Suggests books published within the user’s preferred timeframe.

+ Author Filtering – Prioritizes books by authors the user likes

### Results and Discussion
The chatbot was successfully tested locally, confirming that it can generate relevant book recommendations. 
However, since the model has not been deployed, users must run it manually on their machines. 
Future work will focus on hosting the chatbot online to enable wider access.
